## Validation

### HTML Validation

For my HTML files I have used [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

I have had to follow a different approach for validating my HTML for this project as the majority of my pages are developed using Jinja syntax such as '{% extends "base.html" %}' and '{{ form|crispy }}' and most require user authentication. The HTML validator will throw errors if I were to use my website's URL so I have had to follow the below approach for every page:

- Via the deployed Heroku app link, I have navigated to each individual page.
- Right clicking on the screen/CTRL+U/âŒ˜+U on Mac, allows a menu to appear, giving me the option to 'View page source'.
- The complete HTML code for the deployed page will appear, allowing you to select the entire code using CTRL+A/âŒ˜+A on Mac.
- Paste the copied code into the [validate by input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) option.
- Check for errors and warnings, fix any issues, revalidate by following the above steps and record the results.

![html validation](#)  

All HTML pages were validated and received a 'No errors or warning to show' result as shown above.

Initially my Profile and Article Page HTML were receiving [validator errors](#), [error code generated from Summernote code](#) of having an extra p tag due to Summernotes rendering. I fixed this issue by replacing the p tags with divs, redeployed and checked for any styling issues. All clear on re-validation thankfully.

### JavaScript Validation

[JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate the small amount of JavaScript code added to the project. External JS, for Bootstrap purposes, obtained via [CDN](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.2.3/js/bootstrap.min.js) was not validated through JSHint

| Page | Screenshot | Errors | Warnings |
| ---- | ---------- | ------ | -------- |
| base.html | ![js from base.html](documentation/testing/base_js.png) | none | none |
| gallery.html | ![js from gallery.html](documentation/testing/gallery_js.png) | none | none |
| profile.html | ![js from profile.html](documentation/testing/profile_js.png) | none | none |

### Python Validation

Python validation was performed using [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) 

All errors were rectified with the exception of a single overlength line in settings.py\
This was confirmed as ok as part of settings.py files by cohort learning facilitator.

### CSS Validation 

[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate my CSS file. External CSS for Bootstrap, provided by [CDN](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.2.3/css/bootstrap.min.css) was not tested. Warnings were present, these were related to my use of variables for colors and fonts in my CSS file.

### Lighthouse Scores

Lighthouse testing was carried out in Incognito mode to acheive the best result. Performance was lower than preferred due to the site being image heavy. Images used in the sites design were saved in webp and png format, and compressed using [tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) and [Convertio](https://www.convertio.co) to offer the best chance for a decent performance score. The CDNs used for Bootstrap were also noted in the Lighthouse report as causing issue with performance. This report will be reviewed for future development of Freefido to raise this score.

### Testing User Stories

User Stories are documented in the FreeFido [GitHub Projects Board](https://github.com/users/amylour/projects/4). User Stories are numbered, with Acceptance Criteria and Tasks detailed within. Testing was carried out on Dev Tools for desktop/tablet/mobile, by creating multiple accounts for test users: FidoTest1, FidoTest2, FidoTest3 etc and following through by ensuring that the Acceptance Criteria were met. All features were tested to ensure that they provided the user with the expected output and action.


| User Story | Acceptance Criteria Met? | Tested | Response | Pass/Fail | Fix |
| :--: | -- | -- | -- | :--: | --: |
| [No.](Link) | Yes | Yes | No issues| Pass | - |

### Dev Tools/Real World Device Testing

Responsiveness testing was carried out using Google Dev Tools on the devices detailed within the below table. Responsiveness was evident on all features throughout all tested devices. Occassionally I would have to refresh the page by clicking the 'FreeFido' logo as the page would load zoomed in or out on the simualted device. When refreshed and CSS checked the desired outcome was observed. I put this down to a caching issue in Chrome as this issue was not observed when testing on the available real world devices.

## Virtual Test Environment

Using [statcounter](https://gs.statcounter.com/screen-resolution-stats) to attain the latest (_October 2024_) usage stats, I compiled a virtual testing environment using [Responsive Viewer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/responsive-viewer/inmopeiepgfljkpkidclfgbgbmfcennb?hl=en) with the six most popular worldwide screen resolutions. Although the most popular resolution globally is **1920x1080**, the [data](https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile-tablet) shows usage stats for **61.63% - Mobile**, **36.52% - Desktop** and the remaining **1.85% - Tablet**, thus reinforcing a mobile first approach to responsive design and UX.

| Rank | Resolution | Global Usage |
| :--: | :--: | --: |
| 1 | 1920x1080 | 9.24% |
| 2 | 350x800 | 6.77% |
| 3 | 375x812 | 4.63% |
| 4 | 390x844 | 4.49% |
| 5 | 1366x768 | 4.28% |
| 6 | 1536x864 | 4.15% |

## Bugs  
  
As this was my first Django/Database project, most of the bugs that I encountered were learning and teething issues.\
The below bugs are bugs that I spent a longer length of time investigating or required the assistance of Tutor Support.
