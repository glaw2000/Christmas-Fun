## Validation

### HTML Validation

For my HTML files I have used [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

I have had to follow a different approach for validating my HTML for this project as the majority of my pages are developed using Jinja syntax such as '{% extends "base.html" %}' and '{{ form|crispy }}' and most require user authentication. The HTML validator will throw errors if I were to use my website's URL so I have had to follow the below approach for every page:

- Via the deployed Heroku app link, I have navigated to each individual page.
- Right clicking on the screen/CTRL+U/âŒ˜+U on Mac, allows a menu to appear, giving me the option to 'View page source'.
- The complete HTML code for the deployed page will appear, allowing you to select the entire code using CTRL+A/âŒ˜+A on Mac.
- Paste the copied code into the [validate by input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) option.
- Check for errors and warnings, fix any issues, revalidate by following the above steps and record the results.

![html validation](#)  

All HTML pages were validated and received a 'No errors or warning to show' result as shown above.

Initially my Profile and Article Page HTML were receiving [validator errors](#), [error code generated from Summernote code](#) of having an extra p tag due to Summernotes rendering. I fixed this issue by replacing the p tags with divs, redeployed and checked for any styling issues. All clear on re-validation thankfully.

### JavaScript Validation

[JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate the small amount of JavaScript code added to the project. External JS, for Bootstrap purposes, obtained via [CDN](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.2.3/js/bootstrap.min.js) was not validated through JSHint

| Page | Screenshot | Errors | Warnings |
| ---- | ---------- | ------ | -------- |
| base.html | ![js from base.html](documentation/testing/base_js.png) | none | none |
| gallery.html | ![js from gallery.html](documentation/testing/gallery_js.png) | none | none |
| profile.html | ![js from profile.html](documentation/testing/profile_js.png) | none | none |

### Python Validation

Python validation was performed using [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) 

All errors were rectified with the exception of a single overlength line in settings.py\
This was confirmed as ok as part of settings.py files by cohort learning facilitator.

| Feature | admin | apps | asgi | forms | models | settings | urls | views | wsgi |

### CSS Validation 

[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate my CSS file. External CSS for Bootstrap, provided by [CDN](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.2.3/css/bootstrap.min.css) was not tested. Warnings were present, these were related to my use of variables for colors and fonts in my CSS file.

### Dev Tools/Real World Device Testing

Responsiveness testing was carried out using Google Dev Tools. Responsiveness was evident on all features throughout. 

## Virtual Test Environment

Using [statcounter](https://gs.statcounter.com/screen-resolution-stats) to attain the latest (_October 2024_) usage stats, I compiled a virtual testing environment using [Responsive Viewer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/responsive-viewer/inmopeiepgfljkpkidclfgbgbmfcennb?hl=en) with the six most popular worldwide screen resolutions. Although the most popular resolution globally is **1920x1080**, the [data](https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile-tablet) shows usage stats for **61.63% - Mobile**, **36.52% - Desktop** and the remaining **1.85% - Tablet**, thus reinforcing a mobile first approach to responsive design and UX.

| Rank | Resolution | Global Usage |
| :--: | :--: | --: |
| 1 | 1920x1080 | 9.24% |
| 2 | 350x800 | 6.77% |
| 3 | 375x812 | 4.63% |
| 4 | 390x844 | 4.49% |
| 5 | 1366x768 | 4.28% |
| 6 | 1536x864 | 4.15% |
